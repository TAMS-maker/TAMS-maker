Hi, I'm TAMS

I have a background in web development, with experience in PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Tailwind. While most of my repositories focus on basic projects, they showcase my work with foundational web technologies.

Although I’m no longer pursuing a career as a web developer, I continue to experiment with new tools and learn along the way. I'm now focusing more on IT-related fields, including cybersecurity and IT support.

Feel free to explore my repos, and connect if you're interested in collaborating or discussing new ideas!
